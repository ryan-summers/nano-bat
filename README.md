# NanoBat

This repository contains the hardware and software behind NanoBat, a low-cost tool designed for
engineers and hobbyists to simulate batteries in low-power designs.


## Goals
Develop an open-source PCB design and firmware solution for simulating batteries for low-power
designs with a final cost of less than $100 per unit and can accurately simulate battery capacity
over a 24 hour window with **TBD** accuracy.


## Tools
The firmware will be developed in Rust.

The PCB design will be conducted with Kicad.
